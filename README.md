# Voice-Controlled-Alarm-
This project uses IFTTT applets of Google Assistant and WebHooks to make a voice controlled alarm.

The circuit can be made using a buzzer and a wifi module like bolt which has its own API. So that we can pass commands using the remote API as an HTTP request to GET data from Bolt remote API through the WebHooks applet on IFTTT.

One can make these applets in their IFTTT account,put appropriate HTTP requests ,linked to their email id and with the same id access Google Assistant to switch off the alarm.
This alarm can have various more applications but here I have used it as an alarm clock.
